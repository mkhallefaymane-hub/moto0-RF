Goal: Add a full Admin area to manage listings moderation + manage "Tendances" videos shown on the homepage.
Important: Keep the existing UI/design of the public site unchanged. Only add admin functionality + minimal admin UI.

PART A — ADMIN AUTH + ROUTES
1) Add protected admin routes (e.g. /admin).
2) Require admin login (username/password) before accessing /admin.
   - If auth already exists in the project, reuse it. Do not break existing routing.
3) If user is not logged in as admin, redirect to /admin/login.

PART B — LISTINGS MODERATION (same concept as old Moto0 admin)
1) In /admin, create "Admin Listings" page with tabs:
   - Pending, Active, Rejected, Sold, All
2) Each listing row must show: id, title, type (car/moto), city, price, status, createdAt.
3) Actions for each listing:
   - Approve (Pending -> Active)
   - Reject (Pending -> Rejected) with optional reason
   - Mark Sold/Vendu (Active -> Sold)
   - Delete
4) IMPORTANT business logic:
   - Sold listings must remain visible publicly BUT:
     - show a clear SOLD/VENDU overlay badge
     - disable WhatsApp contact for sold items
     - prevent opening sold listing details OR show a toast “This listing is sold” (whichever is already used in this project—reuse existing behavior)
5) Add Refresh button + loading/error states.
6) Use existing data layer if present. If the project currently uses mock data, implement it with a simple JSON store and local API endpoints so admin actions update what the public site displays.

PART C — TENDANCES (HOMEPAGE VIDEOS) ADMIN MANAGER
1) There is already a "Tendances" section on the homepage.
2) Add a new admin page: /admin/trends (or a tab inside /admin) to manage Tendances items.
3) Admin can:
   - Add new video item
   - Edit existing item
   - Delete item
   - Reorder items (up/down)
4) Video item fields:
   - title (FR + AR)
   - platform (Instagram/TikTok/YouTube)
   - url (the video link)
   - thumbnailUrl (optional; if empty, show a default placeholder)
   - isActive (toggle)
5) On the homepage, Tendances must render ONLY active items in the saved order.
6) Keep the public design the same; only data becomes editable by admin.

PART D — QA + SAFETY
1) Do not break existing pages, routes, language switch (FR/AR), WhatsApp flow, search, footer pages.
2) Add basic validation:
   - URL must be valid
   - title required in both languages
3) Provide a short checklist in the final message: how to test admin login, approve/reject listing, add a trends video and see it appear on homepage.

Deliverables:
- New admin pages + minimal admin navigation links inside admin only
- Data persistence approach explained (mock JSON or API)
- No unnecessary UI redesign
