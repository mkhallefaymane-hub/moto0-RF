Goal: Fix missing Safety page link, make search functional, and improve hero text readability with a subtle dark overlay. Keep the current UI design and layout unchanged (no redesign), only small safe changes.
Tasks:
1) “Conseils de sécurité” page not visible
Do NOT recreate pages from scratch. Reuse the existing Safety page that already exists (the one used for /safety?redirect=...).
Ensure there is a public route for it (example: /conseils-de-securite and/or /safety).
Add it in the Footer under “LÉGAL / SUPPORT” (same style and spacing as other links).
Make it bilingual:
French: “Conseils de sécurité”
Arabic: “نصائح السلامة”
Clicking it should open the full Safety content page (not only the redirect overlay unless redirect param exists).
2) Search bar is not working
Make the hero search input actually filter/navigate:
When the user types keywords (brand, model, city, year, fuel, price, mileage, any word from listing data), it should show matching results.
On clicking “Rechercher” or pressing Enter: navigate to /listings and apply the search query.
Implement “universal search” across all listing fields:
title, brand, model, city, year, mileage, fuel, price, description (any available)
If no results: show a clean “No results” state with a reset button.
Keep existing UI, only wire logic.
3) Hero background readability
The hero background image (Dacia) is too bright and hides the text.
Add a subtle dark overlay that:
Keeps the image visible (only “a bit”)
Makes text clearly readable
Prefer a modern solution:
gradient overlay (e.g. black 60% top → 30% bottom)
or blur + dark overlay
Do NOT change hero layout, fonts, buttons, or positioning. Only add overlay layer / adjust opacity.
Acceptance checklist
Safety page appears in footer/menu and can be visited directly.
WhatsApp redirect still goes to the safety interstitial with countdown + skip.
Search works from hero and filters listings.
Hero text is readable and image still visible.
Proceed with changes and report exact files modified + routes added.
