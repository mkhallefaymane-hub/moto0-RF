You are working in FAST MODE. Do not propose upgrades.

Goal: Implement a minimal admin panel for Moto0 with listing moderation + homepage trends manager, using local JSON storage only.

Hard constraints:
- Keep the existing UI/design unchanged for public pages (homepage/listings/detail).
- No database, no auth, no external services.
- Use ONLY local JSON files + simple Next.js API routes (or equivalent in this repo).
- Small, incremental changes; avoid refactors.

Data storage:
- Create a local JSON file (e.g. /data/admin-store.json) with two arrays:
  1) listings: [{ id, status }] where status is "PENDING" | "APPROVED" | "REJECTED" | "SOLD"
  2) trends: [{ id, title, url, platform }] (platform optional)
- If the project already has mock listings data, do NOT move it. Only store statuses in the JSON store keyed by listing id.

Admin panel:
1) Add a route/page: /admin
2) Show two tabs/sections:
   A) Listings moderation:
      - Table: id, title, type (car/moto), city, price, current status
      - Buttons per row:
        Approve -> status=APPROVED
        Reject  -> status=REJECTED
        Mark Sold -> status=SOLD
        Reset -> status=PENDING
      - Use API routes to read/write the JSON store.
   B) Trends manager:
      - List existing trends videos
      - Form to add new video (title + url + optional platform)
      - Button to delete

Public behavior:
3) Public listings/cards must reflect SOLD status:
   - If listing is SOLD, show a clear "SOLD / VENDU" badge overlay on the card image.
   - Keep card layout the same; only overlay/badge.
4) Listing detail page:
   - If SOLD, disable WhatsApp/contact CTA and show a small notice "Sold" (bilingual FR/AR using existing i18n).
5) Homepage "Tendances" section:
   - Read videos from the JSON store trends array.
   - Render them exactly in the existing Tendances UI (do not redesign).
   - If the Tendances UI is currently static, replace only the data source with the JSON data.

Internationalization:
6) Any new labels in admin can be French only (OK), but public-facing SOLD text must be bilingual FR/AR via existing i18n keys.

Testing:
7) Add a quick manual test note at the end:
   - Go to /admin, mark a listing SOLD, verify badge appears on public card and contact disabled on detail.
   - Add a trends video in /admin and verify it appears on homepage.

Deliverable:
- Implement the changes, keep edits minimal, and do not change unrelated code.
